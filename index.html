							<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
							<p>Prior to gaining my experience as a Government Contractor, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of
								 Maryland, College Park. Since my graduation I have self-studied various technologies, systems, applications, 
								 and issues to fulfill my duties professionally and satisfy my interests. To increase my exposure to other professionals I joined ISACA, specifically 
								 the Washington D.C Chapter. As a member I have attended their seminars for Powershell and cloud auditing, gaining valuable insight and knowledge.
								  In the coming months I will be pursuing a SANS Institute / GIAC certification, followed by a masters certificate with SANS Institute to 
								 solidify my current and future knowledge and abilities.

							<h2>CERTIFICATION</h2>
							<p>To validate my experience, knowledge, and abilities I have obtained vendor neutral certification with CompTIA. 
								Currently, I hold the CompTIA CySA+ certification which encompasses the abilities to perform incident detection, 
								prevention, and response through continuous security monitoring. Previously, I validated my baseline skills 
								necessary to perform core security functions by retaining the CompTIA Security+ certification. In the future, 
								I will be seeking SANS Institute training accompanied with GIAC certification to broaden my knowledge and abilities.

						<h2>MAKING AN IMPACT</h2>
						<p>My career goal as a Cybersecurity professional is to develop expert knowledge and abilities to prepare, prevent, detect, respond, 
                            contain, eradicate, and recover from incidents to decrease the frequency and magnitude of cybercrime and breaches. Currently, I am 
                            in the beginning of a long career of learning and adapting to rapidly changing technologies and environments. I am driven to utilize 
                            my personal knowledge and abilities, while continuing to gain education, training, and certification.
