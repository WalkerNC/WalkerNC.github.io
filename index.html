							<p>	<h3><b>Information System Security Officer (ISSO)</b></h3>

									<h4>3 Reasons Consulting LLC | DHA, Naval Information Warfare Center NIWC Atlantic – I-SPAR Team</h4>
									As an Information System Security Officer (ISSO), I lead Risk Management Framework (RMF) efforts across multiple systems, producing comprehensive 
									compliance documentation, conducting in-depth vulnerability assessments, and sustaining system accreditations through continuous monitoring. I work closely 
									with ISSMs, engineers, and system administrators to develop robust security policies, detailed architecture diagrams, and accurate technical inventories. 
									Additionally, I serve as the Siphon Firewall Request Approver and manage the submission of I-SPAR reports for 34 systems, ensuring timely and precise 
									reporting in support of mission-critical operations.

									<h4>3 Reasons Consulting LLC & Clearwaters.IT | Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, NSA Bethesda</h4>
									In a leadership role as an ISSO, I managed a 35-person team supporting over 8,000 users and 12,000 devices, delivering expert-level technical support across 
									Windows environments, Microsoft 365, and Cerner MHS Genesis. I led major IT transitions, including the migration from Windows 10 to 11 and the successful rollout of Cerner 
									MHS Genesis. My responsibilities included maintaining SharePoint sites, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and workflow documentation, while also resolving high-level 
									technical issues through Active Directory and ServiceNow. This role demanded both strategic oversight and hands-on problem-solving to ensure seamless operations across a
